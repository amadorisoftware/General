# What is Amadori Software?

Amadori Software is a project born in February 2020. One of the first sites to provide was "Amadori's Restaurant" born as a joke. The project was then abandoned in March 2020. 
The developer and owner of the company, Lorenzo Amadori, has begun to develop various Beta Projects on the WWW (World Wide Web). One of these is Dr.Tech, a very advanced Technology Forum that has about 10 members, 2 of which are active. 
So the Project is on the verge of extinction but Amadori Software doesn't want this to happen.
Currently, on 04-11-2020, Dr.Tech is at Version 1.8 (H38). With version 2.0 (Stable) Amadori Software will undertake to advertise the Project to expand it to at least 30 weekly users.
The cost of the servers of all Amadori Software Sites is Free, so a boring banner is shown in the footer.
Dr.Tech is one of the many sites offered by Amadori Software, visit the other Projects to find out more.
